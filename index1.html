    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Wilfred Gil 18 years old a first year college student in CAVSU Naicto be honest, the course I will take should not be Computer Science because 
	the course I really intend to take is an electrical engineeting course because I already know something about this course because I already have experience in
	this course because I already have a field in this school but because my grade didn't reach the requested grade I didn't get it and the second choice should be 
	information technology/IT but I filled up the wrong course in Computer Science so now I'm learning to make a webpage and do coding for a better future and since 
	this is the course I took, I will continue for my future. .	</p>
